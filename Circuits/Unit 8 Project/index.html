   <h1>Aliya Scribner</h1>

    <p>Mostly self-taught, Iâ€™m currently engaging myself with a variety of courses at General Assembly with the intention of kick starting a career in Web Development. Before going back to school I worked as a Teacher for Students with Disabilities with a focus on teaching technology skills. My aim is to find a role where I can immediately contribute my skills to a company in a compelling way.</p>
